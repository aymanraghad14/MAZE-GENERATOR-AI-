The Maze Generator Project is a program designed to automatically create mazes of varying sizes and complexities. Using algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS), Prim's, or Kruskal's, it generates unique solvable mazes with customizable dimensions.

Key Features:

Adjustable maze size (rows Ã— columns)

Multiple generation algorithms

Visual output (console or GUI)

Option to export/save mazes

Possible Extensions:

Maze solver integration

User interaction (gameplay)

3D maze generation

This project is great for learning algorithm design, recursion, and problem-solving while creating fun, interactive mazes.

Example Tech Stack: Python (with Pygame/Tkinter), Java, or C++.
